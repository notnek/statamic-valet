# Statamic Valet Driver
This is a [Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet) driver for supporting [Statamic's](https://statamic.com) full static caching. To use, add the `LocalValetDriver.php` file to your project
and set your `STATAMIC_STATIC_CACHING_STRATEGY` environment variable to `full`. You can now test static caching locally with Valet.
